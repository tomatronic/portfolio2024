                                <p>Publishers and advertisers on Rakuten's affiliate network needed to understand their contribution to sales beyond last-click attribution. When a customer discovers a product through Publisher A's blog, researches it via Publisher B's review site, then purchases after clicking Publisher C's discount link, who deserves credit?</p>
                                <p>Without this visibility, publishers couldn't prove their value in earlier phases of the funnels, and advertisers couldn't optimize their partnerships. Competitors like CJ Affiliate and Impact offered journey tracking, putting Rakuten at a strategic disadvantage.</p>

                                <h2 className="pt-10 text-xl tracking-tight">Challenge</h2>
                                <ul className="mb-8 space-y-2">
                                    <li><b>Data complexity</b>: A single customer journey could have up to 15 touchpoints across 30 days. Multiply that by thousands of conversions, and you have overlapping, non-linear paths that are nearly impossible to parse visually.</li>
                                    <li><b>Dual audiences</b>: Publishers needed to see "Where do I contribute?", Advertisers needed "Which publishers work together to drive conversions?". Same data, different questions and mental models.</li>
                                    <li><b>Trust</b>: Users needed confidence to make budget decisions, which meant explaining the complex attribution logic without overwhelming them.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <h2 className="pt-10 text-xl tracking-tight mb-12">Approach</h2>
                                <p>Through interviews with both internal account managers and external users, I learned taht users wanted answers to specific questions with the ability to dig deeper when needed, not open ended data exploration.</p>

                                <p><b>Key insight</b>: Start with answers, allow exploration.</p>
                                <h3 className="pt-10">Key design decisions</h3>
                                <ul className="mb-8 space-y-2">
                                    <li><b>Three-phase framework (Awareness → Consideration → Conversion)</b>: Rather than showing raw click sequences, I organised journeys based around purchase phases. This created a mental model: "Am I/a Publisher driving discovery, research, or final purchase?"
                                        This framework solved two critical problems:
                                        It simplified multi-touch attribution into digestible stages
                                        It gave publishers language to prove their value beyond last-click: "I am strong in awareness" becomes a selling point, not a liability
                                        Other frameworks considered (first/middle/last click, paid/organic/direct channels) didn't align as well with the awareness/consideration/conversion model, which aligned best with how marketers already think about funnels.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><b>Two-tab structure Contributions vs. Touchpoints</b>: Contributions tab: High-level summary ("You contributed to 45% of conversions in the awareness phase")
                                        Touchpoints tab: Detailed journey paths for users who wanted to dig deeper
                                    </li>
                                    <li><b>Dual-audience design</b>: Publishers see their own contribution. Advertisers see all publishers in each journey. Same data structure, different views. The core visualisation is adapted to work for both user types, without increasing engineering efforts.</li>
                                </ul>

                                    </div>
                                    <p>The Activity Summary presents raw data up front, total clicks, across phases, average clicks to conversion and baseline contributions. It allows users to quickly understand perforb before diving into complex journeys.</p>

                                    <p>The three-phase framework transformed abstract click sequences into a clear narrative. Publishers could now say "I drive 40% of awareness conversions" instead of struggling to explain their role. Advertisers could identify which publishers were performing well at different stages of the journey.</p>
                                    <p>For deeper analyses the Touchpoints tab revealed detailed conversion paths, presenting which sequences benefitted them most.</p>

                                    <p>The default filters prevented cognitive overload while still giving users control. As users updated filter choices the report updates seamlessly.</p>
