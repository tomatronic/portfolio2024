                        <p className="text-base font-medium">I decided I wanted to find a new project for myself. I wanted to create something that would both challenge me as a designer but also still provide a solution to a problem.</p>
                        <p  className="mb-16 text-base font-medium">So what did I decide? After spending a long time thinking about what I enjoyed and how I may be able to transform this into a project I came up with the concept of 'Brewtiful'. The basis to the idea is that craft beers often feature great designs on the cans and bottles they are distrubuted in. I noticed that although there are many websites and apps out there that focus on the beer itself very few mentioned the design effort.</p>

                            <p className="mb-16 text-base font-medium">Create a magazine/blog style website that focuses on craft beers and the packaging they are delivered in. Each beer will be reviewed in a way that entertains but also educates.</p>

                            <p className="text-base font-medium">So now I had my idea in place I wanted to give it name. I wanted to be able to refer to this idea as a brand and not just a thing. I also new I needed to create my goal. So my next steps was to come up with a name and an end goal.</p>
                            <p className="mb-16 text-base font-medium">I decided I wanted to highlight that the brand involved beer and design, I knew I wanted a name that was easy and played on words. After many hours of searching the internet, checking domain availabilities and social channels names I settled on the name 'Brewtiful'! More on this in a bit.</p>

                            <p className="text-base font-medium">My initial task was to explore what options were already available to try and gain an understanding of where my idea may sit.</p>
                            <p className="mb-16 text-base font-medium">I collated a few of the sites into a list and identifed where they were similar and if they offered any unique selling points. I then plotted my proposal against these findings.</p>

                                <p className="mb-16 text-base font-medium text-gray-700">My next task was to work out who my audience was and what they might want to get from this new site. As this is a personal project my access to research is a little more limited, but I went ahead and created a couple of personas based on data I could find. I focused on the two sides of this project, the beer lover and the design lover. The end goal is to create a project that an be enjoyed by both parties. Creating these personas will help ensure I stay as user centric as possible.</p>

                            <p className="text-base font-medium">Now was time to start thinking about what content would make up this site.</p>
                            <p className="text-base font-medium">In order to start sketching some ideas I decided to plan out a rough IA (Information Architecture) in order to identify the pages that would need designing.</p>
                            <p className="text-base font-medium">The site would likely be fairly simple and built in a way that I could reuse a template for multiple pages. I wanted to ensure that adding new content was not a labourious task. With this in mind I identified 5-6 main pages/templates I would require:</p>
                            <p className="text-base font-medium">
                                &bull; <b>Homepage</b> - Something that promotes new content and encourages interaction.<br />
                                &bull; <b>A search / directory page</b> - This could be used for both beers and breweries.<br />
                                &bull; <b>Beer bio</b> - A page for a single beer, this is the most information packed of the pages.<br />
                                &bull; <b>Brewery bio</b> - I would keep this quite simple, basic details and reviewed beers.<br />
                                &bull; <b>Blog</b> - This can be kept fairly simple. The main focus is the beer!<br />
                                &bull;  <b>Resource pages</b> - This includes 'about', 'contact' etc.
                            </p>
                            <p className="mb-16 text-base font-medium">At this point I have a good idea about the structure of the site. It's time to start thinking about design.</p>

                            <h2 className="pt-16 text-xl font-semibold tracking-tight">Initial sketches</h2>
                            <p className="text-base font-medium">I decided to take pen to paper again at this point and begin sketching some ideas. I wanted to get a rough idea of what may work and aimed to identify information that may or may not be needed on the pages.</p>
                            <p className="mb-16 text-base font-medium">The idea of quick scribbles like this allows me to perform multiple iterations in minimal time. It also helps begin the process of creating more of a brand identity.</p>

                            <p className="text-base font-medium">I felt at this point that the project was at a good point. And although not a huge step I decided to grab my favourite of the previous sketches and reproduce them in an ever so slightly better version.</p>
                            <p className="mb-16 text-base font-medium">This new version of the mockups helped me further understand how the final page may look. A few tweaks added here and I am strting to be very happy with the design direction.</p>

                            <h2 className="pt-16 text-xl font-semibold tracking-tight">Prototyping</h2>
                            <p className="text-base font-medium">I followed a slightly alternate route to what I would usually. I decided to go ahead and create a few prototypes that I could then try and gather some feedback on.</p>
                            <p className="mb-16 text-base font-medium">At this point I wasnt sure how I would go about getting some testing completed, or gather feedback. I didnt want to rely on friends and collegaues due to the risk of bias opinion. I opted to try reddit... Not a conventional approach and arguably not much better than asking friends and family as I dont know the background of those that respond.</p>
                            <h2 className="pt-16 text-xl font-semibold tracking-tight">Feedback</h2>
                            <p className="text-base font-medium">My approach of using reddit was not something I would usually do. It is not focused enough to gain true user insights and instead relies on the people commenting understanding the use case and having some design knowledge.</p>
                            <p className="mb-16 text-base font-medium">However, ignoring the above, the response from the unknown people reviewing my UI was positive. This was reassuring and also gave me some ideas for iterations.</p>

                            <h2 className="pt-16 text-xl font-semibold tracking-tight">Project reflection</h2>
                            <p className="mb-16 text-base font-medium">Being a personal project I am happy with where I have got to. I hope in the future to iterate on this further and maybe even take a dive into building this into a real life website.</p>
                            <p className="text-base font-medium">The design process required a bit more discipline than other projects I have worked on as I had to find time around my work and social life. I think if I embark on a similar project in the future I will make sure to plan time each week to focus solely on the idea.</p>
